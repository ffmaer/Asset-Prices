[Businesses hire people who have skills that help them, and a GPA is not a skill. - David Backus](https://web.archive.org/web/20200923102701/http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~dbackus/undergrad_advice.htm)

Dave liked to quote Einstein. "Make things as simple as possible, but not simpler." I still remember his voice as he taught us. Now I saw this sentence again in [one of his class notes](https://web.archive.org/web/http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~dbackus/233/notes_econ_2periods.pdf). His voice is with me again.

David Backus Quotes:

* Some people find the apparent lack of realism of economic models puzzling, but it’s often necessary to gain sharp insights. The idea is to focus on the things that matter, and simplify or ignore the things that don’t. [source](https://web.archive.org/web/http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~dbackus/233/notes_econ_2periods.pdf)
* Lots of people do research: analysts, academics, etc. The content varies, but there’s a common theme. Research is about (i) asking an interesting question and (ii) providing an informative answer. [source](https://web.archive.org/web/http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~dbackus/233/notes_econ_bounds.pdf)
* Lots of things in economics and finance are forward-looking: decisions made now depend on things we expect to happen in the future. [source](https://web.archive.org/web/20200923102850/http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~dbackus/233/notes_econ_forward.pdf)
* All of modern macroeconomics, and most of modern finance, is concerned with how randomness unfolds through time. [source](https://web.archive.org/web/20151014082812/http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~dbackus/233/notes_math_stochprocesses.pdf)
* Linear algebra is one of the great things in life, something you should think about learning if you want to have more fun in life. [source](https://web.archive.org/web/20151014082812/http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~dbackus/233/notes_math_stochprocesses.pdf)

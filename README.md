[Businesses hire people who have skills that help them, and a GPA is not a skill. - David Backus](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~dbackus/undergrad_advice.htm)

Dave liked to quote Einstein. "Make things as simple as possible, but not simpler." I still remember his voice as he taught us. Now I saw this sentence again in [one of his class notes](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~dbackus/233/notes_econ_2periods.pdf). His voice is with me again.
